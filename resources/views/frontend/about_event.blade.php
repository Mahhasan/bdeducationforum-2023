                                    <p style="font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
                                        There is a direct captive market of the large Non-Resident Bangladeshi (NRB) community, 
                                        for Bangladeshi Universities and Medical Colleges to explore. More than 50,000 Bangladeshi 
                                        families live in the UAE among the 1.2 million NRB population in the UAE.<br> <br>

                                        Each of the 50,000 families have more than two children – making Bangladesh student community size 
                                        to at least 100,000. If they are split into 12 grades, one would find than more than 8,000 students 
                                        seek higher education every year, after finishing 12th Grade. Let’s say 25 percent might pursue higher 
                                        studies in USA, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Germany and East European countries. 
                                        That still makes a potential market of 6,000 students per year to explore and benefit from. 
                                        If a university can enrol 20 students in the first year, it will have multiplier effect from the next year.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Now, those who don’t maintain families here but earns a salary between Dh4,000 to Dh6,000 per month, 
                                        would want to send their children (studying in Bangladesh), to universities and colleges in Bangladesh, 
                                        funded from the father’s income in the UAE and GCC. </p>
